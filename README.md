Some major roadblocks run into on this one. No. 1 problem: Bootstrap. This has been giving me problems from Day 1 of this course. Not sure what I'm doing wrong but for some reasons the Bootstrap elements just do not glom on to my code and it's frustrating as heck. Gave me major headaches during our mini-group project on Sept. 21 (restaurant reservation app). The results modal -- just could not get it to work, nor did I have an easy time finding exactly what I wanted on the Bootstrap . 

Spent about 20 hours on this homework. Got lots of help from online study group and online tutorials, one of which was directly related to this project. Also tried my best to examine the soluttion to the restaurant reservation group project for clues. Some of it worked, some of it didn't.
